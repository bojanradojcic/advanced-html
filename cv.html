      <h3>Education</h3>
        <p class="body">Bachelor of Journalism, Magna cum laude, emphasis in Strategic Communication Design / Missouri School of Journalism, University of Missouri - Columbia </p>
      <h3>Relevant Experience</h3>
        <h4>Designer, Morningstar Inc. / Chicago, IL</h4>
        <p class="body">The Fund Research group is responsible for providing independent and unbiased research
           and analysis on a variety of investment vehicles. Working closely with a team of
           analysts and researchers, I was involved in print, interactive, and visualization projects
           designed to give investors knowledge and information to make smart financial
           decisions.
        </p>
        <h4>Art Director, Design Bureau Magazine / Chicago, IL</h4>
        <p class="body">Launching a brand new magazine, I collaborated with the editorial staff on naming, conceptualization
           and general direction for branding, editorial tone and visual identity.
           I was responsible for developing the grid structure, typographic system, and formulating
           the design language. Following the launch, my duties included issue layout and
           production, feature design, photo-shoot concepts and coordination, event and marketing
           collateral, and designing, developing and maintaining the magazine’s Web site.</p>
        <h4>Art Assistant, Jeremy Scott Design, Los Angeles, CA</h4>
        <p class="body">Collaborating closely with the designer, I created artwork, prints, and patterns for
           the designer’s own collection showcased biannually during Paris Fashion Week, and capsule
           collections for ADIDAS ORIGINALS.
