      <p class="body">Launching a brand new magazine, I collaborated with the editorial staff on naming, conceptualization
         and general direction for branding, editorial tone and visual identity.
         I was responsible for developing the grid structure, typographic system, and formulating
         the design language. Following the launch, my duties included issue layout and
         production, feature design, photo-shoot concepts and coordination, event and marketing
         collateral, and designing, developing and maintaining the magazine’s Web site.</p>

      <p class="body">Collaborating closely with the designer, I created artwork, prints, and patterns for
         the designer’s own collection showcased biannually during Paris Fashion Week, and capsule
         collections for ADIDAS ORIGINALS.
